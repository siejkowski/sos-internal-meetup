vision 1:

<!-- intro -->
# Swift is available on linux! we can write backends!

* story: with a character, Joe the iOS Ninja Wizard
* not to talk about thingsâ€¦ talk about experiences and stories

<!-- section1 -->
# I want to try Swift for backend
* what library to choose?
* do i have all the tools?
* how to start? simplest hello-world, running locally
* few hello worlds: html, xml, json
* simple templating, static files serving

## recap section1

<!-- section2 -->
# Happy with hello world, now I want to do some hackathon project
* Slack bot: proxy, simple templating
* how to deploy to heroku?
* how to develop on linux?

# recap section2

<!-- section3 -->
# Happy with personal site, now i want to make some real app prototype
* sharing code between ios client and backend
* deploying to any machine with docker
* additional development tools (swift version management)
* is it composable? how to mix and match libraries? what about swift package manager?
* testing and debugging
* crud (database connectors), https, gzip, binary data

## recap section3

<!-- outro -->
# Happy with real app prototype, should I move to production?
* this is only my perspective! mere recommendations!
* how does the libraries work under the hood: modulemaps, shims
* is it stable?
* what is missing?
* monitoring tools
* architecture models (like actor model, rxswift for linux)
* swift js?
* performance
* middleware
* BaaS who support swift
* continous integration
* lint
* backend for frontend
